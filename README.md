## The basics

### Classic "Hello World!" app

Let's build a casual Hello World app.

Note that STRING is the default data type - you don't need to add quotes!

```
-flush Hello World!
```
* The Output:
```
Hello World!
```
<!---Variables--->
### Variables

It's like in PHP!

```
$variable = world
$head = Hello
```

And how to implement it into a string:

```
-flush $head $variable
```
* The output:
```
Hello world
```

### IMPORTANT! Prefixes

There are some prefixes:
* Variables ($)
* Functions (-)
* Objects (#)
* Constants (_)
* Decorators (@)
* Keywords (?)
* Comments (/)
